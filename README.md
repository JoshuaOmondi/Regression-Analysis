# Life Expectancy Regression Analysis

Welcome to the Life Expectancy Regression Analysis project! This analysis focuses on exploring various factors influencing life expectancy using statistical methods and building a regression model to predict life expectancy for individuals. The data for this project is obtained from Kaggle.

## Project Overview

Regression analysis is a powerful statistical technique that helps us understand relationships between different variables. In this project, we perform an in-depth analysis of life expectancy data to uncover insights about the factors that impact how long individuals live. We then proceed to build a regression model that predicts life expectancy based on these factors.

## Data Source

The data used in this analysis is sourced from Kaggle's life expectancy dataset. The dataset contains a collection of variables related to various countries' demographics, economics, healthcare, and more.

## Analysis Steps

1. **Data Exploration**: We perform an initial exploration of the dataset, examining its structure, missing values, and statistical summaries of variables.

2. **Feature Selection**: We identify relevant features that could potentially affect life expectancy, such as GDP, education, healthcare expenditure, etc.

3. **Correlation Analysis**: We analyze the relationships between variables and their correlation with life expectancy. This helps us understand which factors have the most significant impact.

4. **Data Preprocessing**: We clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values and transforming variables if necessary.

5. **Regression Model Building**: We construct a regression model using appropriate techniques (linear regression, multiple regression, etc.) to predict life expectancy based on selected features.

6. **Model Evaluation**: We assess the model's performance using appropriate metrics and visualize the results.

## Regression Model

The regression model created in this project aims to predict life expectancy based on a combination of factors. The model can be used to estimate how different variables contribute to a person's life expectancy.
